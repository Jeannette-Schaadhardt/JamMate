# JamMate

JamMate is a 2024 Senior Capstone Project created by: <br>
Brandon Koehler <br>
Jeannette Schaadhardt <br>
Kevin Johnson

## The Goal:
Develop a web app called JamMate for finding musicians and artists via social media-like functionality using JS / HTML / CSS, hosted on Google Cloud Platform.

## Requirements:
Create a profile with various items like your instrument, experience level, preferred genre/styles, etc.
Create posts detailing what you are looking for and allow users to post their own personal ads
Enable users to upload audio and/or video samples of their music
Create a review system allowing other users to drop comments Allow search functionality so users can filter by an acceptable radius, instrument, skill level, etc.

## Development:
Developing Locally (for us. this might get complicated the more dependencies we include, so we will expand more for our sake):

1. npm install
2. npm start - open browser on localhost:9001

Possible work flow for this is to use Visual Studio Code,fetch the repository from Github, run **npm install**, then with context on the server.js go to **Run -> Start Debugging**.
This will recognize the this as a nodejs application and run it accordingly.

## Bootstrap.

Bootstrap can be utilized by going to the [Bootstrap Docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) and copying in the templates desired into the html.

For online development you do not need to do any npm installs or change the .js file.<br>
Instead just have the CDM style sheet link and the CDM javascript link placed in the html file as shown [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/).
