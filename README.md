The Goal:
Develop a web app called JamMate for finding musicians and artists via social media-like functionality using JS / HTML / CSS, hosted on Google Cloud Platform.

Requirements:
Create a profile with various items like your instrument, experience level, preferred genre/styles, etc.
Create posts detailing what you are looking for and allow users to post their own personal ads
Enable users to upload audio and/or video samples of their music
Create a review system allowing other users to drop comments Allow search functionality so users can filter by an acceptable radius, instrument, skill level, etc.

Developing Locally (for us. this might get complicated the more dependencies we include, so we will expand more for our sake):

1. npm install
2. npm start - open browser on localhost:9001
